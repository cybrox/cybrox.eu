                        the term "side" less dominant in the title but given that I am terrible
                        at designing intuitive visual clues, you probably missed that.

                            Arduino Sketch for creating an all-in-one IR and computer remote.<br />
                            Because handling remotes
                            for multiple devices is laborious and retail all-in-one remotes are ugly bricks, this aims
                            to solve the problem in a more creative way. An arduino with IR sender- and receiver is used
                            to translate signals from one, small remote into IR signals expected by various devices.
                            Additionally, since the device used is a 32U4 based device, its keyboard emulation capabilites
                            are used to implement general remote control functionality for the connected computer.

                            A convenience project for scheduling on cheap Roombas.<br />
                            Born from the research for finding a WiFi and Bluetooth capable development board. The ESP32
                            running FreeRTOS has proven to be one of the best devices out there for tinkering low-level network
                            connected applications. Wroomba uses Roomba's Open Interface (ROI) for interfacing with Roomba cleaning
                            robots and exposing a simple HTTP API for starting cleaning. The software is considered finished as is,
                            since it does it's only job - automatic cleaning - very well. However, there's still a broken Roomba
                            around that could need some additional tinkering.

                            Inspired by <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/led-cloud-connected-cloud">this SparkFun project</a>
                            it became clear that our office needed a cloud connected cloud as well. While mainly started as a fun project,
                            this proved to be a good opportunity for playing with multi-connection socket handling and message passing in
                            Elixir. The cloud server will either fetch the current weather information or be manually controlled by a simple
                            webinterface.

                            An Elixir wrapper for using the INWX "domrobot". <br />
                            This was my first attempt of writing a package for the hex package manager and generally one of
                            my very first actual Elixir projects. The current implementation, while completely untested, has
                            few enough moving parts to probably not break instantly. However, it does stay a learning experience
                            and not a stable software.

                            technical details. Either way, the site succeeded in helping the team with organizing sign-up and fan-out
                            for newsletter and registrations to all participants and led to a successful world record.

                            Factorio mod to clean up the mess created by custom modpacks.<br />
                            Using pretty solid shell- and ingame hook based tooling, this mod collected item and building information
                            from all mods in order to create templates for sorting them in proper categories. Ultimately, while the
                            mod did find some success, the effort of sorting the ever-growing modbase and the comparably low adaption
                            lead to it not being developed any further. Last time I checked, the mess without it is still horrible.
                            If nothing else, this sure was a huge LUA and Bash learning experience!

                            A bot for winning steamgifts.com gifts without effort. <br />
                            Let's face it, botting on giveaway sites is not exactly the most holy move in the book. While other sites
                            had harsh restrictions on it, though, steamgifts was rather liberal in handling botting. Giving away games
                            to rank up and then botting higher-level rewards seemed like a pretty fair trade. The project got eventually
                            defunct because everyone using it, myself included, lost interest in winning random games.

                            A very pragmatic MVC-ish PHP framework. <br />
                            Not being satisfied with the state of PHP MVC frameworks at the time, I decided to write my own, very pragmatic
                            framework for solving exactly the problems I faced. While this obviously was no great success and was written
                            way to specific, it still was exciting creating a web framework from the ground up. I have since moved on to
                            better frameworks and miles away from PHP.

                            Arguably the most important project in kickstarting software development for me. After building some convenient
                            tools for the community, I joined the team as the second dev ever "hired". I do take pride in knowing that I
                            pulled the project and the team through some tough times until we got more developers on board and I eventually
                            burned out on working on it.<br /><br />
                            I went into this mess of Ruby on Rails and hacky JS tooling, not knowing a single bit of either and left from
                            a textbook dockerized Ember/Rails application. While I can only take credit for a small portion of all of that,
                            it is save to say that this was one of the most amazing projects I ever had the chance to work on. Still riding
                            at the front of technological development, I wish the company that has grown out of this humble hobby project
                            nothing but the best.

                            GitHub. Years after actual development, this project's license has been changed to the classical MIT license

                            While CrunchDB probably does a lot of things right in terms of conveniently querying and updating information,
                            it does just about everything wrong in being an actual production-ready database. - For a very good reason, though.
                            Back in the day, I was building lots of PHP tools, mostly for myself or internal purposes which required an easy
                            to set-up and easy to handle database without all the complexity of an actual database system. Thus, CrunchDB was born.
                            A terribly inefficient file-based database without locks or syncs but just right for single-person applications.

                            in the community, this was what eventually led to me joining the site team, building Hummingbird for over a year and

                            An online status site for nitrado.net <br />
                            Originally started as a convenience tool for users to monitor the status of their minecraft server, with me becoming
                            part of the Nitrado team, the site was extended to cover most of the services active at the time. The site has not
                            been updated since I left the team due to a lack of new endpoint information and the hoster has since moved on to
                            providing their own status site on a third-party service.
